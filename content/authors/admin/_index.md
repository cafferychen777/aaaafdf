I am a sophomore in Southern Medical University majored in biostatistics.

I got 2020-2021 National Scholarship from Ministry of Education of China. Only 0.2 percent of China's top students receive this honor each year.

I am very good at mathematical modeling and have won a lot of awards in many national competitions. And in my freshman year, I worked as a research assistant in a scientific research on grass-roots health quality assessment through standardized patients, which has been completed and the results have been put into practice.

Now I'm looking for a summer research on genomics. If you can offer a opportunity, please feel free to contact me.
